			<h2>Conclusions</h2>
			<p>Analyzing the results of our experiment we were pleased with the results. Low percentages
 			of estimated power use by the applications and small amounts of data traffic lead us to believe Coauthentication
 		as a method of continuous authentication could soon be a successful method for commercial use. Having an
 	  authentication method where users don’t have to worry about forgetting passwords or just as important practicing
    poor security hygiene is an exciting development.
    It is important to note that we did perform the same experiment with the smartwatch while it was plugged into a
		charger as this did allow the device to directly connect to the WiFi. The application ran for the full 8 hours same
		as the first experiment with one difference, we haven’t measured the battery stats from the watch yet since the
		 experiment should be performed without the device being connected to a charger. Reason being the watch has a
		 weaker battery than the smartphone so it is important that it can handle implementing the protocol continuously.
		  All things considered, given these results we believe many things will be possible with this continuous authentication method after further testing.
</p>
				<h2>Future Research</h2>
			<p>Since this is the first of many experiments yet to be performed with coauthentication for continuous
				 authentication, we have high hopes for research. In the future the research we plan to continue includes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Finding a way for android smartwatches to connect directly to the Internet while Bluetooth paired. </li>
				<li>If unable to make direct connection to the Internet we will alter the protocol to perform message forwarding
					so that only one device needs to communicate with the authenticator. The method will still verify that both the requestor
					and collaborator devices participate in the coauthentication. The change to the protocol will be similar to one of the other
					verified protocols written in the CoAuthentication paper. </li>
				<li>Perform the same 8 hour experiment with the requestor and collaborator connected to cellular networks.
					It is important for the results to be similar to the test done over WiFi so that everyday use of the authentication method is possible. </li>
				<li>Perform these experiments on active smart devices of everyday users in multiple applications to represent commercial implementation
					of the authentication method. If these tests go well then we will know the method will be possible to use. </li>
				<li>When authentication fails, we must have a way for users to log back into their applications if they plan on not having two devices with them or if one is stolen.
					 Whatever method we choose, there must be a contingency when coauthentication cannot be used. </li>
				<li>Given the continuous authentication method works perfectly and is good for implementation in applications
					 we can conduct surveys on large data sets possible teaming up with companies with a large number of users on their applications.
					  In the surveys we can test the usability of the method as many people will stick to known authentication methods if they think experience too much interference. </li>
				<li>Find additional applications for continuous authentication using coauthentication for instance in the medical field. </li>
