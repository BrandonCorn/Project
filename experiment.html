			&emsp;The experiments performed in previous implementations of behavioral and physiological
			methods of continuous authentication mainly tested for FRR, FAR, and EER. Surveys were
			used to find user opinion of usability. None of these methods performed experiments testing
			 for battery drainage or data traffic from the device applications implementing the continuous
			 authentication methods. For our experiment we wanted to evaluate these two aspects of the
			 protocol running continuously on two mobile smartphones. <br>

		&emsp;  The experiment we performed used two Huawei mateSE smartphones, one as the Requestor and one as the
		 Collaborator. we ran the coauthentication protocol on an application continuously for 8
		 hours and the screen on for both devices. After the 8 hours bug reports were taken from both devices to be analyzed. <br>

		&emsp; The goal of the two experiments was to find that the difference in the battery drainage of the
		 two devices was small. We also wanted to be sure the application itself was using very little battery power.
		 Thirdly we wanted to see that the amount of data traffic was low from both devices.
		 We ultimately want this application to work with a smartphone and a smartwatch since many users possess both nowadays.
		  When users are away from WiFi both devices will require use of cellular data.
			Since not all users possess unlimited data plans the protocol must not be taxing on that data. <br>

			&emsp; Before performing the experiment both devices needed to be charged to 100% battery power so
			that if the applications were to drain all of the power we can see how long the application ran before
			the device was drained. Before the applications were run, we reset the battery stats and cleared the logcat
			of both devices so that when analyzing the bug reports, all the statistics pertain to the 8 hours the experiment was being performed.
			Each smartphone must have bluetooth pairing capabilities in order to execute the protocol so prior to running the applications the devices must be paired.
			In addition, only necessary services should be running on the device prior to initiation.
			This gives an accurate estimate of how much battery would be used over the 8-hour period running just the continuous authentication application.
			The laptop, requestor, and collaborator were all connected to the same WiFi network and left in the same spot so that there was no worry about connectivity issues.
			The screen on both devices was left on for the full 8 hours to represent an application using the protocol in the foreground. <br>

			&emsp; When running the protocol on the applications continuously we had issues where the collaboration request message sent via Bluetooth
			 from the collaborator to the requestor would randomly drop the last two bytes causing an exception and closing the app.
			 In our run this exception was thrown for about 8% of the authentication attempts.
			 To keep the application running we altered the code to log catch this exception and log it as failed authentication.
			 When this error does not occur the authentication attempts are always successful so once this is fixed there should be a 100% success rate for the coauthentication protocol.<br>

			 &emsp; The other issue we had was with connecting the smartwatch directly to the WiFi for the experiment.
			 Ultimately we want the coauthentication method to work primarily between a smartphone and smartwatch,
			 however when a smartwatch is Bluetooth paired with a smartphone it makes requests through the smartphone.
			 This results in the two devices sharing an IP address which causes messages from the authenticator to be sent to the wrong device.
